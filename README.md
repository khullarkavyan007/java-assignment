This project is a JavaScript console-based quiz game created for Web Dev Lab Assignment 4. It uses an array to store questions, a loop to display them, `prompt()` to take user input, `alert()` for feedback, and functions for clean code. User answers are normalized using `toLowerCase()` and `trim()`, and the score is tracked and shown at the end. The quiz runs by opening index.html and viewing the browser console.
